# Reminder Application

Python Flask + Mongodb

This is a application to help you set you daily reminder. It can save the date and information of a reminder. If you are done with a reminder, you can also toggle the *done* field.

## Progress
I have set up the project environment and containerize the project. Currently, the API to get all reminders is available.

## How to run
Clone the project and go to the project directory.
Then

`docker-compose up`

will down load the recquired images and set up the environment.

The REST API server is running on http://localhost:5001
and the mongodb server is running on http://localhost:27018

## ToDos
- Developing more APIs
- Deploy it on AWS
